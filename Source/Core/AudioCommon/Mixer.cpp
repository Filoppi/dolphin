    // -Only play backwards if the number of missing samples is greater than "n", otherwise do padding.

    // -Play backwards half of the missing required samples, then play back forwards the other half.
    //    The good thing of this approach is that it blends well when it toggles the direction and normal playback resumes,
    //    but unfortunately, it's arbitrary as if we had a backend latency of "0", we'd mix 1 sample per time, so
    //    switching between playing old samples back and forward wouldn't be possible, unless we abstracted latency (the number of required out samples)
    //    from the code and cached a series of variables (e.g. play back 15ms of sound, then play these forwards again).
    //    This might work out better but is long to implement, but that 15ms of sound would again be an arbitrary number which might sound better or worse
    //    depending on the current sound waves
    // Once we have run out of old samples to play, this will output silence. Alternatively, we could have played them forwards again, but the likelihood of running out of samples with the
    // current buffer size is extremely rare: not worth considering.
    // ---------------------
    // I don't think constantly changing direction between backward and forward when we are out
    // of samples can ever work. I've been trying. the 2 problems are:
    // -if it's not latency agnostic, you'd play back half of the missing samples backwards, and
    // then from the point you reached, play the same set forwards again (so that if emulation
    // resumes, the last played sample would be the matching the first new sample) so the above
    // would be fine, except the way it sounds depends on your current backend latency, and if you
    // have a very low backend latency, you'd never have enough time to let a few sound waves play
    // smoothly without inverting the playback direction again
    // -if it is latency agnostic, then we'd
    // play a pre-decided number of samples backwards, and then the same number forwards again, over
    // one or more audio frames. This would keep ping-ponging until we don't have any new samples
    // again, this would be all right in some case, but then, when you actually receive the new
    // samples from the DMA, you are going to have to interrupt the ping point in a random place,
    // and that defeats the purpose of doing the ping-pong in the first place unless you wait for
    // the ping-pong cycle to be finished, but that would introduce latency which is insane if you
    // are already not at full speed the only remaining solution i can think of is to cross fade but
    // from my tests it doesn't seem to be necessary, cracklings aren't bad enough, they aren't
    // really disturbing, they are very low, and it's not like dolphin didn't have them before.
